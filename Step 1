Hello, and Welcome to my Av Botz Application!

This file is my submission for Step 1 of the application process.

A Pipe is a simple, linear form of communication from one object to another. It is easy to use, easy to debug, and not very complex. 

Shared memory is a dedicated space in the memory that many different objects can communicate with each other, both reading and writing data.

If I was to pick one of these to use, I would have to look at the project specifications first in order to decide which one I would use. For a simpler,
more basic problem I would use pipes, however if the project was more expansive and complex, using shared memory would be much more useful. However,
due to the fact that AVBotz uses many different objects that communicate with each other, I predict that using shared memory will be more widespread.
While pipes may be more efficient, I think it is much more convenient to use shared memory when dealing with a complex program.
